# Project SmartGrid

In this project there is a hypothetical neighborhood with 150 houses. Each of them 
create electricity through solar panels and need to store that in a battery. These 
batteries are collective and spread through the neighborhood, connected to the houses
by electricity cables.
Given the location of the houses, the goal of this problem is to find the shortest 
way to connect each house to a battery or the lowest price to connect this neighborhood.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the following code, make sure you have at least 4 MB free space on your computer and
that you installed python version 3.6.3. If you have a previous version, please go to 
https://www.python.org/downloads/ and get yourself the proper version.

### Installing

Go to https://github.com/11014067/Heuristieken and download the folder "Heuristieken" to your
local machine. You can either download the zip and unpack it, of copy paste all folders to a 
newly created folder. In the last case, make sure the folder is empty (including possible 
hidden files).

## Getting started

To start the algorithms and recreate the solutions of the problem, you open your terminal and 
go to the folder where you saved 'Heuristieken'. Enter the command:

```
python main.py
```

or

```
py -3 main.py
```

Now follow the instructions on the screen.

## Infrastructure

There are several sub folders containing functions, algorithms, visualizations and datasets, 
to increase conspectus and facilitate reusing certain aspects of the code. A quick summary 
of all the folder and their containments:

* Deprecated - 
* Information - Information about the case and the neighborhoods: datasets with coordinates 
				and computed upper and lower bounds for the solution.
* Test - Older versions of functions and algorithms, conserved for research purposes only.
* Visual_solutions - Visual representations of solutions to the problems. The main.py code is 
					 designed to save newly created solutions automatically here.
* ignore - Necessary to ignore *.pyc files, not necessary to run any algorithm.
