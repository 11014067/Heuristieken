# Visual solutions folder

In this folder you can see all the visualisations from the solutions we have found, and new visualizations are automatically saved in this folder.
For easy access the visualisations are sorted in neighborhood folders, where each neighborhood has its own folder. 
There is also a folder with the very best solutions called best solutions, in that folder the best solution of each neighborhood is stored.

### Visualizations

Every visualization has the following characteristics:
* A grid, 50 by 50.
* Batteries, each one has a different color.
* Cables, the cable has the color of the connected battery.
* Houses, the houses has the color of the connected battery.

* On top of every visualisation are the cable length and the price.

### Finding the right file

Names are created by "fig_" + sorting method + neighborhoodnumber + "x"/"y"/"voltage"/"r" the batteries where sorted on + "x"/"y"/"voltage"/"r" the houses are sorted on ("None" if not used) + "_ " + the amount of batteries used.

If something is sorted "r" it means that it is sorted on random.

In the folder Best solutions all folders are named neighborhood + neighborhood number. 

### Marks

Some visualtions might be older versions, so they might not contain the price or other aspects. To be sure you have the most updated version, please run the main.py file.
